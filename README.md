# FinancialModel
I build this Financial Model to calculate both 
the capital over a certain period of time, 
with a certain interest rate and 
an optional monthly additional payment,
and the necessary start capital to aquire a wanted capital, 
again, accomanied by a given monthly additional payment, yet again,
over a certain period of years.
